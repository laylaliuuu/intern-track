This repo uses Cursor project rules.

NOTE: This file is a hint/convenience reference. Cursor does not guarantee it will be read first or at all.

Real enforcement layers:
1. Cursor Settings (global rules - always active and applied globally; repo rules add project-specific constraints)
2. .cursor/rules/*.md (repo rules - typically auto-discovered, source of truth for this repo)
3. .cursor/commands/*.md (repo workflows - typically auto-discovered)

Key files:
- .cursor/rules/intern-tracker-mvp.md (core product invariants - source of truth for this repo)
- .cursor/commands/dev.md (development workflow)

Rule priority: If repo rules conflict with global rules, treat repo rules as source of truth for this repo.
